### Dataset Explanation

- The dataset used in this project is the Yelp Review Full dataset, which is a large collection of product reviews along with their star ratings. The dataset is publicly available on the Hugging Face datasets repository and can be accessed [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yelp_review_full).

- The dataset was introduced in the paper ["Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626) by Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. The paper explores the use of character-level convolutional networks for text classification tasks.

- The Yelp Review Full dataset is particularly suited for tasks such as star rating prediction and sentiment analysis. Each review in the dataset is associated with a star rating, which can be used as a proxy for the sentiment expressed in the review. The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately predict the star rating of a review based on its text content.
