I am a Master student at Politecnico di Milano CS program. I have been selected for <br>
<b>PoliMi Honours Program</b> and I am currently working with Professor Manuel Roveri at AI-Tech Research Lab .

My research interests include <b> Machine Learning/Deep Learning, TinyML, ML Efficiency and Learning Representations </b>. <br>
My current research focuses on the <b>bit allocations of the quantized neural networks in the mixed precision dynamic settings</b>. Focusing on how the information propagates through the network and the theoretical bounds of the compression.<br>

In my previous experiences I have worked on Complex systems, Recommender Systems, and Nanonetworking projects. <br>

You can find some side projects on compressing some computer vision and language models among [my github repositories](https://github.com/mehmetemreakbulut). <br>
