I am a Master student at Politecnico di Milano CS program. I have been selected for PoliMi Honours Program and I am currently working on my thesis at AI-Tech Research Lab with Professor Manuel Roveri.
My research interests include Machine Learning/Deep Learning, TinyML, ML Efficiency and Learning Representations.
I am also interested in the intersection of AI and Embedded Systems. I am passionate about learning new technologies and I am always eager to learn new things.
My current research focuses on the the <b>bit allocations</b> of the quantized neural networks in the mixed precision dynamic settings. Focusing on how the information propagates through the network and the theoretical bounds of the quantization.
You can find some side projects on compressing some computer vision and language models among my github repositories.
